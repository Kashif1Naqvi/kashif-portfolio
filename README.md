This repo contains the code for a portfolio site that has a rich user-experience, is performant, and accessible. The website is built using HTML, SCSS, vanilla JavaScript, and it doesn't use any CSS or JavaScript libraries or have any framework dependencies. Everyone is welcome to contribute or use it as a template for their portfolio. Please give me (this repo) credit for the theme design.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You need [Node.js][node] to develop the site locally on your computer.

### 🔋 Step #1. Install the Dependencies

```sh
   npm install
```

### 📟 Step #2. Start the Development Server

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at [`http://localhost:1234`][local] that you should browse to check the local dev version of this site.

### ♻️ Step #3. Production Build

```sh
npm run prod
```

This script will create the production build that contains the site code, which is fast and optimized and minified for production.
